# Claude Code Project Template - Documentation Overview

## Purpose
This template provides a comprehensive starting point for AI-assisted development projects using Claude Code. It includes pre-configured sub-agents, custom commands, automation hooks, and best practices for productive AI-human collaboration.

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Agent System
Seven specialized sub-agents for different aspects of development:
- **Master Orchestrator**: Coordinates complex workflows
- **Planning Architect**: Technical design and architecture
- **Code Reviewer**: Quality assurance and best practices
- **Test Engineer**: Comprehensive testing strategies
- **Security Auditor**: Vulnerability detection and fixes
- **Documentation Specialist**: Clear, maintainable docs
- **Performance Optimizer**: Speed and efficiency improvements

### 2. Custom Commands
17 slash commands organized by category:
- **Development** (`/dev:*`): Feature development workflow
- **Project** (`/project:*`): Project management tasks
- **Git** (`/git:*`): Version control operations
- **Security** (`/security:*`): Security scanning and compliance

### 3. Intelligent Automation
Four automation hooks for productivity:
- **Auto-formatting**: Consistent code style
- **Command approval**: Safe command execution
- **Intelligent automation**: Smart agent triggering
- **Security checks**: Automated vulnerability scanning

### 4. Project Structure
Well-organized template with:
- Clear directory structure
- Comprehensive documentation
- Test suite included
- CI/CD workflows
- Issue templates
