Hey there! 👋 Welcome to the Claude Code Project Template - your new best friend for AI-powered development. This isn't just another boilerplate; it's a carefully crafted starting point that makes Claude Code feel like a senior developer on your team.

## Why You'll Love This Template

Ever wished Claude could understand your project as well as you do? That's exactly what this template does. We've spent countless hours figuring out how Claude "thinks" and built a structure that speaks its language:

### 🧠 **Claude Speaks Your Language**
Think of it as giving Claude a map of your project. The CLAUDE.md file acts like a project handbook, and every folder is organized just how Claude expects. No more explaining your project structure over and over!

### 🤖 **Your AI Development Team** 
Imagine having 7 specialized developers at your disposal - that's what our multi-agent system feels like. Need architecture help? There's an agent for that. Security review? Covered. Testing strategy? You got it. The master orchestrator is like your project manager, making sure everyone works together smoothly.

### ⚡ **Work Smarter, Not Harder**
The template knows which commands are safe to run automatically (like formatting or linting) and which need your approval. It's like having a really smart assistant who knows when to check with you and when to just handle things.

### 🔒 **Security Built Right In**
We're not just talking about adding a linter here. This template bakes in security best practices from the ground up, with automated checks that catch issues before they become problems. Sleep better knowing your code is being watched over.

## What's In The Box? 📦

- 🤖 **7 Specialized AI Agents** - Like having a whole dev team in your terminal
- ⚡ **Smart Auto-Approval** - Claude handles the boring stuff automatically
- 🎯 **Custom Slash Commands** - Type `/dev:feature` and watch the magic happen
- 🔧 **4 Automated Hooks** - Auto-formatting, security checks, and more
- 🏗️ **Modern Python 3.12+** - All the latest goodies: type hints, async, the works
- 🔒 **Security-First Design** - Catches vulnerabilities before they ship
- 🌐 **MCP Server Magic** - Connect to 15+ external tools (GitHub, Slack, databases, you name it)
- 📝 **Smart Context System** - Claude always knows what's going on in your project

## Get Started in 2 Minutes ⏱️

Ready to feel like you have superpowers? Let's go:

```bash
# 1. Grab the template
git clone https://github.com/dbankscard/claude-code-project-template.git my-project
cd my-project

# 2. Make it yours (interactive setup included!)
python scripts/initialize_project.py my-awesome-app
cd my-awesome-app

# 3. Fire up Claude Code
claude

# 4. Try something cool
> Hey master-orchestrator, let's build a user auth system with OAuth2 and JWT tokens
```

That's it! Claude will coordinate the agents to design, implement, test, and document your feature. Pretty neat, right?

## Meet Your New AI Team 🤝

### The Agents (Your New Best Friends)

- **🎭 Master Orchestrator** - The project manager who knows exactly who to call
- **🏗️ Planning Architect** - Designs your system architecture like a pro
- **🔍 Code Reviewer** - That senior dev who catches everything
- **🧪 Test Engineer** - Makes sure your code actually works
- **🛡️ Security Auditor** - Keeps the bad guys out
- **📚 Documentation Specialist** - Actually writes the docs (yes, really!)
- **⚡ Performance Optimizer** - Makes everything blazing fast

### Automation That Actually Helps

No more forgetting to format your code or run tests. The template handles it:

- **Auto-formatting** on save (Python, JS, JSON, Markdown)
- **Security scanning** before commits (no more accidental API key leaks!)
- **Smart test running** (only runs tests affected by your changes)
- **Agent suggestions** ("Hey, this looks like it needs a security review!")

### Commands That Make Sense

Instead of remembering complex git commands or workflows, just use:

- `/dev:feature "user profile page"` - Creates the whole feature
- `/dev:review` - Gets a thorough code review
- `/git:commit` - Writes a proper commit message
- `/security:audit` - Checks for vulnerabilities
- `/project:plan "scaling to 1M users"` - Designs the architecture

### Connect to Everything 🌐

MCP servers let Claude interact with your favorite tools. During setup, we'll detect what you have installed and help you connect:

- **GitHub/GitLab** - Create PRs, manage issues, review code
- **Databases** - Query PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis
- **Google Drive** - Read and write documents
- **Slack** - Send updates, get notifications
- **And 10+ more!** - Puppeteer for web scraping, memory for persistence, etc.

The best part? It's all automatic. Just run the init script and choose what to enable.

## Why This Works So Well 🎯

### We Speak Claude's Language
Instead of fighting against how AI thinks, we embrace it. The CLAUDE.md file is like a project manifesto that Claude can instantly understand. Every file, every folder, every command - it's all organized the way Claude's brain works.

### Specialists, Not Generalists  
Just like a real dev team, each agent has their specialty. You wouldn't ask your database expert to design your UI, right? Same principle here. Each agent is really, really good at one thing.

### Automation That's Actually Smart
We only automate the stuff that makes sense. Format code? Sure, do it automatically. Delete a database? Let's check with the human first. It's automation with common sense.

### Security Without the Hassle
Security is baked in from the start. The template catches common mistakes before they happen. No more accidentally committing API keys or leaving SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### Built to Scale
Start simple, grow complex. The template works just as well for a weekend project as it does for your next startup. Commands and agents scale with your needs.

## Behind the Magic ✨

Here's how it all comes together:

1. **Smart Setup** → Run init script, answer a few questions, done!
2. **Claude Gets Context** → Reads CLAUDE.md and instantly knows your project
3. **You Give Commands** → Type naturally or use slash commands
4. **Agents Collaborate** → Master orchestrator gets the right experts involved
5. **Automation Kicks In** → Formatting, testing, security checks all happen automatically
6. **You Ship Faster** → More time building, less time on boilerplate

## What You'll Need 🛠️

- Python 3.12+ (for the modern stuff)
- Claude Code CLI (obviously!)
- Git (for version control)
- A few minutes to set up
- That's it!

## One More Thing... 🎁

### A Real Example: Building a Feature

Here's what happens when you ask Claude to build a user auth system:

```bash
You: "Hey master-orchestrator, let's build a user auth system with JWT"

Claude: "Great! I'll coordinate the team to build this properly. Let me get started..."

🏗️ Planning Architect: "I'll design a secure JWT-based auth system with refresh tokens..."
✅ Master Orchestrator: "Plan approved. Starting implementation..."
💻 Claude: "Implementing user model, auth endpoints, JWT middleware..."
🔍 Code Reviewer: "Found a potential timing attack in password comparison. Fixing..."
🧪 Test Engineer: "Writing unit tests for auth endpoints, integration tests for JWT flow..."
🛡️ Security Auditor: "Verified secure password hashing, proper JWT expiration..."
📚 Documentation Specialist: "Documented API endpoints, authentication flow..."

You: "Awesome! Ship it!"
```

That's the power of the template. One command, and a whole team gets to work.
