## Examples

### Create Hotfix for Critical Bug
```
/git:hotfix "Fix payment processing error"
```

### Hotfix with Version
```
/git:hotfix "Security vulnerability patch" v2.1.1
```

### Emergency Hotfix
```
/git:hotfix "Critical data loss prevention" --emergency
```

## Hotfix Workflow

```mermaid

hotfix: Fix critical payment processing error

This hotfix addresses a critical issue where payment processing
fails for amounts over $1000 due to decimal precision errors.

The fix:
- Uses Decimal type for all calculations
- Rounds only at final step
- Adds validation for edge cases

This issue affected approximately 5% of transactions and has
been verified in staging environment.

Fixes #critical-123

# üö® Hotfix: Payment Processing Error

## Critical Issue
Payment processing fails for orders over $1000, causing customer transactions to be declined despite valid payment methods.

## Root Cause
Floating-point precision errors in tax calculation causing total to exceed authorized amount.

## Fix Applied
```python
# Before (broken)
total = subtotal * (1 + tax_rate)  # Float arithmetic

# After (fixed)
from decimal import Decimal, ROUND_HALF_UP
total = (Decimal(str(subtotal)) * (Decimal('1') + Decimal(str(tax_rate)))).quantize(
    Decimal('0.01'), rounding=ROUND_HALF_UP
)
```

## Testing
- ‚úÖ Unit tests added for edge cases
- ‚úÖ Tested with production data samples
- ‚úÖ Verified in staging environment
- ‚úÖ Performance impact: negligible

## Rollout Plan
1. Deploy to production immediately
2. Monitor payment success rate
3. Verify no new errors introduced

## Rollback Plan
```bash
# If issues arise
kubectl rollout undo deployment/api
# or
git revert v2.1.1
```
```

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Security Patch
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# emergency-hotfix.sh

echo "üö® EMERGENCY HOTFIX PROCEDURE üö®"

# 1. Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/security-critical main

# 2. Apply security patch
patch -p1 < security-fix.patch

# 3. Commit with GPG signature
git commit -S -m "security: Critical vulnerability patch

SEVERITY: CRITICAL
CVE: CVE-2024-12345
IMPACT: Remote code execution possible

This patch must be applied immediately to all production systems."

# 4. Fast-track testing
npm run test:security
npm run test:smoke

# 5. Tag and push
git tag -s v2.1.1-security -m "Emergency security release"
git push origin hotfix/security-critical --tags

# 6. Trigger emergency deployment
kubectl set image deployment/api api=myapp:v2.1.1-security --record
```
