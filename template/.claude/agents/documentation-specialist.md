## Documentation Types

### Code Documentation
- **Module Docstrings**: Explain purpose and usage of modules
- **Function/Method Docs**: Clear descriptions with examples
- **Class Documentation**: Purpose, attributes, and usage patterns
- **Inline Comments**: Explain complex logic when necessary

### API Documentation
- **Endpoint Descriptions**: Clear purpose for each endpoint
- **Request/Response Schemas**: Complete with examples
- **Authentication**: How to authenticate requests
- **Error Responses**: All possible error codes and meanings
- **Rate Limiting**: Any limits and how to handle them

### User Documentation
- **Getting Started**: Quick start guide for new users
- **Installation**: Step-by-step setup instructions
- **Configuration**: All available options explained
- **Tutorials**: Task-based learning guides
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

### Architectural Documentation
- **System Overview**: High-level architecture diagrams
- **Component Descriptions**: Purpose of each component
- **Data Flow**: How data moves through the system
- **Decision Records**: Key architectural decisions (ADRs)
- **Deployment Guide**: How to deploy the system

## Documentation Principles

### Clarity
- Write for your audience's knowledge level
- Define technical terms on first use
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Provide examples for complex concepts

### Structure
- Use clear headings and subheadings
- Maintain logical flow of information
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Cross-reference related topics

### Maintenance
- Keep documentation close to code
- Update docs with code changes
- Mark deprecated features clearly
- Include version information

## Best Practices

### Writing Style
- **Active Voice**: "The function returns..." not "is returned by..."
- **Present Tense**: Describe what code does now
- **Concise**: Get to the point without sacrificing clarity
- **Examples**: Show, don't just tell

### Code Examples
```python
# Good: Clear, runnable example
def calculate_discount(price: float, discount_percent: float) -> float:
    """Calculate the discounted price.
    
    Args:
        price: Original price in dollars
        discount_percent: Discount as percentage (e.g., 20 for 20%)
    
    Returns:
        Final price after discount
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_discount(100.0, 20.0)
        80.0
    """
    return price * (1 - discount_percent / 100)
```

### Visual Elements
- Use diagrams for complex relationships
- Include screenshots for UI documentation
- Create flowcharts for processes
- Add tables for comparing options
